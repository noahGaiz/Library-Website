# Library-Website

This is a project I got given to me in my second year of college.We were told to make this website a live one where we will locally host is on our machine.I was using XAMPP control panel.I am unaware if I am able to host a live website on my github page but I added all the files from the project including the databse I created from phpMyAdmin.The first step to starting this project I decided to make the database first. I created 4 tables(users,books,category,reserved).All these tables are connected using one to one or many to one relationships.After adding data constraints,primary keys and foreign keys to my databse I uploaded it to phpMyAdmin. After I decided to start implementing new pages to my website.I started by creating the index page and register page. The index page only holds the description of what the website does and has some links that branch to the user registering a new account or logging in if they previously have.

Then creating the register page, its just one big form with a couple contraints making sure the user inputs the right data or follows a couple rules. I added a functio that compares the users input password to the users input confirm password to make sure the user chooses and remembers their password. Some other constraints are that the phone number is 10 numbers long and the password must be 6 characters or longer and checks if the username already exists.All this logic and constraints are done server side using php and partially done client side with html.Lastly in this page I added a link so that the user can go back to the index page.When the user registers,I make sure to start a SESSION in php and connect to my databse. After I create a SQL statement to insert the data into the 'user' table into my databse.Once it checks if the data meets the constraints and inserted into the database,then it sends the username the user inputted into the global variable SESSION and then links the user to the books page(the main page where books are shown).

After creating my register page I decided to start making the login page so that the user doesnt have to register every time to enter the website.I used a similar form like the register page but the login page only asks for two inputs,the username and password to the username.After submitting your details to try login, php starts a SESSION so that we can input the username to the global variable. I then used an SQL statement to take the username and password in the database and then checks if a row is brought back from the databse,if so then it sends the username into the global variable SESSION and redirects the user to the books page.If the SQL statement didnt bring back anything then prints username or password is incorrect.

Creating my books page,I had a design planned out. I wanted to have 2 books in one row and then how many rows to show the books.I wanted to show the books in blocks instead of floating words. I ended up having a reserve button inside the block of each book and it says whether a book is reserved or not. If the book is reserved the user is not allowed to reserve the book.In my database in the reserved table I made a composite primary key with using the foreign keys of username and bookID which I called ISBN.Having make the username a primary key that meant the user was only allowed to reserve one book.This page and the reserved book page are the only pages with a proper navigation as I decided the other pages were too short to have one.Additionally this page has a search bar where the user is able to search by book title or author and to narrow the search of a book they are able to search by category too.This requred a long sql statement joining the books table and category table and then having an if statement to check if the user inputted a category which adds more sql statement if there is a category inputted too.If the user has a book reserved or a book is already reserved then the button to reserve doesnt appear for the user and must wait for the book to be unreserved or unreserve the book they have reserved currently.

My last page I used was the reserved books page.All this page does is show cases the book the user has reserved and shows a button for the user to unreserve it.After the usre unreserves the book the sql updates the books table and updates the book that it shows its no longer reserved by somebody.

Throughout my website I used consistent CSS.All the pages has the same background image.I reused the same shade of colours which was dark blue for borders and light blue for text boxes.I had 3 css files.One file was used by the index,login and register page which was kept consistent throughtout the website.The books and register page had extra css like the naviation bar and a couple classes that neatly formatted the books and displayed custom messages throughout the website.

To conclude this library website was a great learning experience working with front end and back end and working with server side technologies like PHP.It was my first time using a datbase with a project and projected my understanding of using databases and queries to retrieve information.If I were redo this project again,I would change my database so that the user is able to reserve multiple books and maybe add a pages system when displayed books as if I had many books, the user would be scrolling down for a long time.
